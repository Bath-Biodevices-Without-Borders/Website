        <p>Team Bath Biodevices is a Vertically Integrated Project at the Univeristy of Bath formed by a diverse and
          multi-disciplinary team that aims to create
          <strong> portable</strong> and <strong>affordable</strong> electrochemical devices that enable fast and reliable water
          quality quantification.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p> At the core of our mission, we are dedicated to address a global challenge: the scarcity of reliable and clean water in
          Sub-Saharan Africa. We believe that access to clean water is a fundamental human right, and our team is driven to make this right a reality for communities facing water scarcity.
          Every step we take, every innovation we make, is fueled bythe desire to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those who lack reliable water supplies.

        <p>
          Join us on this incredible journey as we work towards a world
          where clean water is not a luxury but a basic necessity accessible to all.
